   								<strong>Day 7 (24/12/2015,Thursday)</strong>
   								<p>It was now time the volunteers to say goodbye to their new friends as this was the last day of the camp.The flag was lowered and students shared the new and reviving experience at the NSS camp 2014. This was the time when valuable criticism on what all to be careful about next year camp organisation was discussed.The tiresome efforts of a group of students culminated in the formation of an even larger group of students with a calling mind, persevering nature and a service-oriented attitude- the so called angels of fortitude for this prestigious campaign. Volunteers were willing to put in their best and give it back to the community- their service, talents, knowledge and even funds. They spent 7 fruitful days imputing this idea together, formulating a formal agenda with a firm modus operandi.  All in all, it was truly a remarkable experience for everyone who attended the NSS camp 2015.</p>
